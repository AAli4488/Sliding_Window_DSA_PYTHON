#  DSA with Python

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice using **Python**.
The goal of this repository is to build **strong problem-solving skills**, understand **core concepts deeply**, and prepare for **technical interviews**.
---
##  Topics Covered
###  Sliding Window
- Fixed window problems
- Variable window problems
- Subarray sum & length optimization
- Hash map + window logic

---
---

##  Language & Tools
- **Language:** Python 
- **Concepts:** Arrays, Pointers, Hashing, Sliding Window
- **Focus:** Logic building, time complexity, interview patterns

---

##  Learning Strategy
- Solve problems from **basic → medium → hard**
- Avoid unnecessary shortcuts (sorting/searching unless required)
- Write clean, readable code
- Add comments explaining logic
- Push every solved problem to GitHub

---

## Future Topics (Planned)
- Hashing (Dictionary & Set)
- Strings
- Stack
- Queue
- Recursion
- Linked List
- Trees & Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
